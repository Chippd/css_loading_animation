# CSS "Coding" animation

***If you'd like to see how easy this can be done, I'll be creating a tutorial in an upcoming post. Get notifified about it [here](http://chrisdermody.com/subscribing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=css-loader-repo&utm_campaign=eng_mark).***

This is continuing on my odd fascination with animation in the browser, building on my previous attempt at an [animated SVG graphic](http://chrisdermody.com/animated-svg-loader-mydevportfol-io/) that would illustrate that an app was "coding" a website, originally built for my side project [MyDevPortfolio](https://mydevportfol.io)
